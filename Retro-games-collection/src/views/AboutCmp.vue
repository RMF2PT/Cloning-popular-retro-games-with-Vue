    <h1>Project: Cloning popular retro games with Vue</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      Welcome to my personal project. This is my playground to learn Vue+Vite with Typescript in a
      Test Driven Development (TDD) style.

      <h2>Technologies</h2>
      <p>This is the technologies I'm planning to use in this project:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a> +
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" target="_blank">Vite</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> to have a static
          typechecker for JavaScript
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> to allow the use of variables,
          nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. I know
          that some of this stuff (like
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting)"
            target="_blank"
            >nesting</a
          >) already exists in CSS, but I want to give SASS a try
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://postcss.org/" target="_blank">PostCSS</a>for CSS syntax transformations
          with tools like
          <a href="https://autoprefixer.github.io/" target="_blank">Autoprefixer</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://pinia.vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Pinia</a> for state management</li>
        <li><a href="https://vitest.dev/" target="_blank">Vitest</a> for unit testing</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://playwright.dev/" target="_blank">Playwright</a> for end-to-end (E2E)
          testing
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ricardo Ferreira, and I'm the father of four beautiful kids. My wonderful wife
        and I spend most of our time caring for and nurturing our family.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1999, I had to make a decision and started working as an accountant. Twenty years later,
        I decided to take control of my life and changed companies and jobs. Now, I'm a Product
        Owner of the financial products squad of a cloud ERP made by a Portuguese company.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the little time that I have left, I've never stopped learning, and I'm still trying to
        achieve my passion: be a web developper and create high-quality apps for a better web.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals of this project</h2>
      <p>
        I have already delved into several programming languages, such as Ruby, Python, C#, and
        dived shallowly into some frameworks like Ruby on Rails and React.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year, I became more interested in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and I'm quite
        comfortable with these languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that now it's time to improve my programming skills and expand my knowledge. So,
        I'm building this project to start learning:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
        <li>Vite</li>
        <li>Vue</li>
        <li>TDD</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I love video games, and so do my kids. So, I came up with the idea of recreating some retro
        games like Tetris and Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should have a main page where the user can choose the game to play, and then each game
        will be on its own page.
      </p>
      <p>
        On my first try at the project, I built a Tetris clone with only HTML, CSS, and vanilla
        JavaScript, but I ran into many problems when trying to refactor the code. So I tried to
        recreate the same project using Vite and Vitest for unit testing. It helped, but unit tests
        can only go so far, and I felt that a great part of my tests were only testing if the
        function ran, since most of the inner methods were mocked.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I'm going full head-on with a framework, and since I loved the ease of use of Vite,
        I've decided to go with Vue and I'm adopting almost all of its optional features.
      </p>
      <p>
        It will be a challenging project, but I believe that it will give a boost to my programming
        skills.
