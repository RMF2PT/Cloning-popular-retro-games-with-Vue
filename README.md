# Project: Cloning popular retro games with Vue

Welcome to my personal project.
This is my playground to learn Vue+Vite with Typescript in a Test Driven Development (TDD) style.

This is the technologies I'm planning to use in this project:

- **[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**
- **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** to have a static typechecker for JavaScript.
- **[SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)** to allow the use of variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. I know that some of this stuff (like [nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting)) already exists in CSS, but I want to give SASS a try.
- **[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)** for CSS syntax transformations with tools like [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
- **[Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)** for state management
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)** for unit testing
- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** for end-to-end (E2E) testing

## About me

My name is Ricardo Ferreira, and I'm the father of four beautiful kids. My wonderful wife and I spend most of our time caring for and nurturing our family.

In 1999, I had to make a decision and started working as an accountant. Twenty years later, I decided to take control of my life and changed companies and jobs. Now, I'm a Product Owner of the financial products squad of a cloud ERP made by a Portuguese company.

In the little time that I have left, I've never stopped learning, and I'm still trying to achieve my passion: be a web developper and create high-quality apps for a better web.

## Goals of this repo

I have already delved into several programming languages, such as Ruby, Python, C#, and dived shallowly into some frameworks like Ruby on Rails and React.

Last year, I became more interested in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and I'm quite comfortable with these languages.

I believe that now it's time to improve my programming skills and expand my knowledge.

So, I'm building this project to start learning:

- TypeScript
- Vite
- Vue
- TDD

I love video games, and so do my kids. So, I came up with the idea of recreating some retro games like Tetris and Tic-Tac-Toe using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It should have a main page where the user can choose the game to play, and then each game will be on its own page.

On my first try at the project, I built a Tetris clone with only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, but I ran into many problems when trying to refactor the code.

So I tried to recreate the same project using Vite and Vitest for unit testing. It helped, but unit tests can only go so far, and I felt that a great part of my tests were only testing if the function ran, since most of the inner methods were mocked.

Now, I'm going full head-on with a framework, and since I loved the ease of use of Vite, I've decided to go with Vue and I'm adopting almost all of its optional features.

It will be a challenging project, but I believe that it will give a boost to my programming skills.

## Want to test this repo?

‚ÑπÔ∏è I'm assuming that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) already installed in your system.

‚ùó‚ùó This is a work in progress. Continuous testing should prevent breaking errors, but things don't always run as we expect it to.
